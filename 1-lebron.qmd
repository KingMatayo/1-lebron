# A rookie’s first shot

LeBron James’ first-ever NBA shot was a mid-range jumper, 16 feet from the basket, in his debut game against the Sacramento Kings.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Shots selection chart of Lebron's visit ever NBA game on Oct. 29, 2003. The league was a different world. Post-play dominated, and three-point shots were reserved for specialists."}

Fast forward 20 years, and LeBron, the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, has transformed his game. His shot selection now reflects the modern league: fast-paced, 3PT-heavy, and analytics-driven.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap=" 20 years later on Oct. 29, 2023, LeBron's shots selection chart, looks like this"}

This is the story of how LeBron’s shot selection evolved, and what it reveals about the NBA’s metamorphosis.

# 2003-2008: Living in the paint

In his early years, LeBron relied heavily on his unmatched athleticism. Most of his shots came from the paint, where he dominated defenders with explosive drives and finishes at the rim.

![LeBron's shot choices (2003-08)](assets/lebron_linechart_03_08.gif)

Between 2003 and 2008, over **40% of LeBron’s shots came from the paint**, with mid-range jumpers making up the second-largest proportion. **Threes were an afterthought**, comprising less than 15% of his attempts.
