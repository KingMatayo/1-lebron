# A rookie’s first shot

LeBron James’ first-ever NBA shot was a mid-range jumper, 16 feet from the basket, in his debut game against the Sacramento Kings.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Shots selection chart of Lebron's first ever NBA game on Oct. 29, 2003. The league was a different world. Post-play dominated, and three-point shots were reserved for specialists."}

Fast forward 20 years, and LeBron, the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, has transformed his game. His shot selection now reflects the modern league: fast-paced, 3PT-heavy, and analytics-driven.

This is the story of how LeBron’s shot selection evolved, and what it reveals about the NBA’s metamorphosis.

  )
```

# 2003-2008: Living in the paint

In his early years, LeBron relied heavily on his unmatched athleticism. Most of his shots came from the paint, where he dominated defenders with explosive drives and finishes at the rim.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE,output=FALSE}

# Since this is time-series data - use a custom function to create a line chart - as i did before, but this time make it animated with gganimate

base_lebron_linechart_03_08 <- create_linechart(all_shots,"LeBron James",2003,2008)

lebron_linechart_03_08_v2 <- base_lebron_linechart_03_08 +
  # Animation: reveal a path per season
  transition_reveal(yearSeason) +
  labs(
    title = "LeBron James % of Shot Choices by Court Zone and by Season (2003-08)",
    x = "Season",
    y = "% of Shots",
    color = "Court Zone"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

# Save the animation
# anim_save("./assets/lebron_linechart_03_08_v2.gif", lebron_linechart_03_08_v2)


```

![LeBron's shot choices (2003-08)](assets/lebron_linechart_03_08_v2.gif)

Between 2003 and 2008, over **40% of LeBron’s shots came from the paint**, with mid-range jumpers making up the second-largest proportion. **Threes were an afterthought**, comprising less than 15% of his attempts.

# 2009-2015: Expanding the arsenal

As LeBron’s game matured, so did his shooting repertoire. His time in Miami (2010–2014) marked a critical turning point. Working alongside sharpshooters like Ray Allen and under the analytical tutelage of Erik Spoelstra, LeBron began integrating the three-point shot into his arsenal

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE,output=FALSE}
base_lebron_linechart_09_15 <- create_linechart(all_shots,"LeBron James",2009,2015)

lebron_linechart_09_15_v2 <- base_lebron_linechart_09_15 +
  # Animation: reveal a path per season
  transition_reveal(yearSeason) +
  labs(
    title = "LeBron James % of Shot Choices by Court Zone and by Season (2009-15)",
    x = "Season",
    y = "% of Shots",
    color = "Court Zone"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

# Save the animation
# anim_save("./assets/lebron_linechart_09_15_v2.gif", lebron_linechart_09_15_v2)

```

![Lebron's shot choices (2009-15)](assets/lebron_linechart_09_15_v2.gif)

From 2009 to 2015:

-   Three-point attempts grew from 15% to 25% of his total shots. You can see the drastic change from 2012 (the year he won his 1st championship)

-   Mid-range shots declined to less than 30%.

-   LeBron still attacked the paint though (dunks et. al), with those shots accounting for over 45%

This shift mirrored broader trends in the league, as teams embraced analytics that favored high-value shots—threes and attempts at the rim .

# 2016-2024: The 3PT Era

The modern NBA is a three-point shooter’s paradise, and even LeBron has adapted. Between 2016 and 2023, three-point shots accounted for over 35% of his attempts, a career-high. The paint remains his second home, but the mid-range has largely disappeared

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE,output=FALSE}

base_lebron_linechart_16_24 <- create_linechart(all_shots,"LeBron James",2016,2024)

lebron_linechart_16_24_v2 <- base_lebron_linechart_16_24 +
  # Animation: reveal a path per season
  transition_reveal(yearSeason) +
  labs(
    title = "LeBron James % of Shot Choices by Court Zone and by Season (2016-24)",
    x = "Season",
    y = "% of Shots",
    color = "Court Zone"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

# Save the animation
anim_save("./assets/lebron_linechart_16_24_v2.gif", lebron_linechart_16_24_v2)


```

![LeBron's shot choices (2016-2024)](assets/lebron_linechart_16_24_v2.gif)

The shift isn't just about LeBron. The NBA's average number of three-point attempts per game has more than doubled since his rookie year. The league has transitioned from a post-centric style to a perimeter-oriented game.
